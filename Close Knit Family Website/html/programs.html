				<button class="accordion2"><strong>TUFF Mama Time</strong></button>
				<div class="panelt">
				  <p>Parenting is tough work that requires plenty of time, attention and energy.
				  Often moms are in that key position to �be there� physically and emotionally for
				  their children.  This program offers guidance to the mother who desires to parent with
				  results while also meeting her own needs.  Valerie presents strategies she used and 
				  perfected to help mothers discover how to structure home with a healthy balance that preserves self. </p>
				</div>
				

				<button class="accordion2"><strong>More Involvement, Less Push Back</strong></button>
				<div class="panelt">
				  <p>There comes a time in the life of a family when the helpless infant grows from one whose
				  care requires total responsibility of others and into one who shares in family duties.  This
				  process of growing children into more responsibility can be accomplished gradually and well if
				  done with positive and purposeful parenting methods.  Valerie teaches parents key strategies that
				  produce children who help more with less negative attitude.</p>
				</div>
				
				
				<button class="accordion2"><strong>Table Talk for Closer Family Bonds</strong></button>
				<div class="panelt">
				  <p>A family with members who freely chat with one another is one with closer and more intimate bonds.
				  This program supports parents by giving them communications methods that encourage sound engagements 
				  in the home.  Valerie, a Toastmaster gold-level communicator and TI clubs past-president, teaches proven
				  conversational techniques.  As a bonus, she shares tools she designed for her family that can help other 
				  parents get theirs talking.</p>
				</div>
				

				<button class="accordion2"><strong>The Fortune 500 Household</strong></button>
				<div class="panelt">
				  <p>Any successful Fortune 500 company boasts good infrastructure and operational
				order.  Every member is aware of business flow and objectives; they then have greater 
				confidence in and expressed buy-in for that company.  When a family is similarly viewed,
				parents operate with utmost effectiveness that comes from good planning.  This program presents
				strategies and tools to help parents discover ways to structure their home and life for greater results,
				much like any successful company would.</p>

				<div class="panelt">
				  <p>Some days, every large and small matter seems to cause siblings to fight against one another.  These are
				  times when a parent can find themselves at wits end, constantly playing judge and jury between their warring
				  children.  While some sibling conflict is normal, it is important that parents find ways to intervene that 
				  prevent damaging escalations.  Valerie�s 5 sons and 4 daughters have given her decades of experience dealing
				  with sibling conflict resolution strategies - pointing family members towards better relating.  This program
				  is designed to empower the parent to proactively build peace-making into family routine.</p>
